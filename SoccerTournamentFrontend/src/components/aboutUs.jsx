        <p>
          In the late 90s, Robert Ziegler, an avid soccer fan, coach and parent,
          began taking an academic interest in our broken pre-professional
          soccer system. What fueled the fire was the “news” surrounding the
          game; either official news releases from the organizations themselves
          or regional bulletin boards with anonymous bullies.

          Looking for opportunities to positively influence the game,
          Project30.com was created with the mission to provide authoritative,
          responsible coverage of college and high school aged soccer; promoting
          the game and the players who play it.

          Since 2003, the pre-professional soccer system have undergone a
          renaissance. New leagues, new rules, and reform efforts have been
          implemented, and to accompany the positive growth in the system,
          TopDrawerSoccer.com has become more than just a website, it’s now a
          destination. The home of the pre-professional game.
